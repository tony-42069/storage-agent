New Customer Inquiry
Customer: "Hi, I need a storage unit."
Agent: "Welcome to [Facility Name]! I'd be happy to help you find the perfect storage unit. Could you tell me what you're planning to store?"
Customer: "Furniture from a two-bedroom apartment."
Agent: "Perfect! Based on that, I'd recommend a 10x15 unit. We currently have three available, starting at $150/month. Would you like to hear about our current move-in special?"
Existing Customer Support
Customer: "I need to update my payment method."
Agent: "I can help with that. First, could you verify your unit number and the last four digits of your phone number for security?"
3. Special Handling
Emergency Situations
Agent: "I understand this is an urgent situation. Let me connect you with our facility manager right away. They'll be able to assist you immediately."
Complex Queries
Agent: "That's a detailed question about [topic]. While I can provide basic information, would you like me to have our facility manager call you back within an hour with more specific details?"
